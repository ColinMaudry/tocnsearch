#TOCnSearch

This DITA Open Toolkit plugin is a fusion between the standard tocjs plugin (by Shawn McKenzie) and the little known HTML Search plugin (by Nad√®ge Quaine).
It generates an HTML WebHelp with a table of contents in the left page (thanks TocJS) and a full text search field in the top banner (thanks HTML Search). It's easy to customize.

I modernized it all a bit so that it feels more like 21st century (iframes instead of frames, decent CSS framework).

## TocJS 

(C) Copyright Shawn McKenzie, 2007. All Rights Reserved.

The tocjs plugin generates a Table of Contents for the DITA Open Toolkit's 
XHTML output that can expand and collapse nodes. It is a more usable and 
visually pleasing option than the standard index.html generated by the Open 
Toolkit's dita2html  transformation.

## HTML Search

Copyright (c) 2008 N. Quaine - NexWave Solutions All Rights Reserved. 

The search plugin generates javascript index files from the html files produced by the web transform and a frameset with a simple search feature.

## Change log

### 0.1.0 (TocJS only)

- Enabled easy customization taking pdf2 as a model (XSLT, CSS)
- For the output, reorganized files in subfolders to clean up the root directory (html/, css/, js/)
